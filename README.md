# Em Map
RShiny application that I built to celebrate Em's 365 days of running.

## Description
I utilized a Tile to track the location, which was then displayed on a map. Data was gathered from the Tile using the Tile API. The map and UI were developed as an RShiny app and hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. A bash script is periodically triggered via cron to initiate the data collection process.

## Usage
This project is no longer being maintained.
